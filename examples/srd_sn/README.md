## Firecrown SN: Demonstration

Demonstration of SN focussed utilities. Tutorial notebooks are kept in `Notebook` dir. These results are based on runs in CORI, NERSC. Similar runs are also being prepared in RCC-Midway system. A starter pack for the Midway system is already prepared. 

The likelihood details can be seen in `sn_srd.py` file. 

The input data vectors are kept in `sndata` folder

Inputs require : 1. Hubble diagram - `data.txt` and 2. Covariance matrix - `sys_0.txt` 

The default input files can be generated by the following command : 

`python generate_sn_data.py`

For custom input files, the notebook `Firecrown_SACC.ipynb` can be consulted. 

Sampling details are set in .ini file. An example file : `sn_srd_planck_bao.ini` is kept which performs $SN+CMB+BAO$ sampling.

An example script to submit job in CORI with these inputs, is stored in `submit_job.sh`

The output is stored in `output` directory. For plots and visualization, the `Firecrown_Plot.ipynb` can be consulted.
